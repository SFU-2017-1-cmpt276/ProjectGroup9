                        <h6>hansk@sfu.ca</h6>
                        <p>My name is Hans Kim. I am an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University in the Computing Science program. I received an Associate of Science degree in Computer Science from Langara College. During my studies there, I worked with a small team to develop a database system for an online retail store inventory system. I also developed a small web application that presents box score data from NBA games in a user friendly dashboard to allow users to quickly see results for matches they may have missed. By developing an expertise in computing science, I hope to create more applications to help end-users solve everyday issues.</p>

                        <h4>Princess Macanlalay - Developer</h4>
                        <h6>pmacanla@sfu.ca</h6>
                        <p>My name is Princess Macanlalay and I am a 3rd year undergraduate in Computer Engineering and have a minor in Computer Science. Academically, I’m interested in math and problem solving, which led me to my path choice in university. With a dad that was always surrounded by computers, I’ve always been motivated to work around new technology.  In terms of experience, I worked at Sierra Wireless as a Software Tester for 8 months. There, I’ve gained experience in testing their AirPrime Family Series. I learned how to complete basic manual testing and eventually helped automate their test cases in Python.</p>

                        <h6>ziyoux@sfu.ca</h6>
                        <p>I am a international student and this is my third year in SFU.  My major is computing science.  Things I learned in my previous courses: basic programming skill in c++, the concept of data structure and algorithm, database management system, probability and stat, calculus, numerical analysis, linear algebra and so on.  For now I am taking CMPT 300 that help me to understand the operator system.  I am good at write (essay).</p>

                        <h4>Keith Chan - Data Management</h4>
                        <h6>khc22@sfu.ca</h6>
                        <p>My name is Keith Chan and I am an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University.  I am studying towards a degree in Information Systems, which means I study a bit of business and a bit of computer science.  I am currently in my third year, although I spent my first studying general engineering at UBC.  I have taken most of the required lower division Computing Science classes at SFU, and have a pretty solid understanding of the basics.  I find that I enjoy web development (I’ve spent a little time learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript online) and working with databases.  </p>
